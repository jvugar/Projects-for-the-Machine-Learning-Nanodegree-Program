    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **  Our problem by its nature is binary as we have to decide whether a person makes more than 50K or not. The following three are appropriate models for our problem: Decision Trees; Ensemble Methods; Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees:\n",
    "1) Financial institutions can use it to decide whether to loan a money or not (http://courses.media.mit.edu/2008fall/mas622j/Projects/CharlieCocoErnestoMatt/decision_trees/)\n",
    "2) It requires less data preparation and apparently use of dummy variables can be avoided (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)\n",
    "3) Addition of a new data requires us to rebuild the decision tree from scratch (https://www.techemergence.com/machine-learning-algorithms-for-business-applications-complete-guide/)\n",
    "4) I believe each of the entries are independent enough that we will have a pretty good data split as we go down the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods (AdaBoost):\n",
    "1) As this method is mostly about combining other weaker models, I believe it can be applied in any industry in which using Machine learning would be of use. One of the potential applications can be visually identifying the object. Here is a list of industries where ensemble methods can be used(I believe this kind of reply is more appropriate for ensemble methods as it is just a combination of other ML models at its core): https://medium.com/@yaelg/product-manager-guide-part-1-what-machine-learning-can-do-for-your-business-and-how-to-9f7eb7dced05\n",
    "2) As the idea is basically to take different models, and compound their performances, I believe AdaBoost will do a great job for models that tend to do poor job on their own.\n",
    "3) Sensitivity to outliers and noisy data (http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost)\n",
    "4) As there are seems to be no outliers in our model, I believe this model would be a good candidate relative to our base case (naive predictor)\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM:\n",
    "1) recognition of handwritten arabic/persian digits (https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d370/8948a7efb2ef007c4a6e80948bc7a0d164b7.pdf)\n",
    "2) There are many kernels to choose from (rbf, polynomial); robust to overfitting in high-dimensinal space \n",
    "3) Harder to tune due to the importance of which kernel is chosen (https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms)\n",
    "4) Given the number of features in our data and that SVM performs well in high-dimensional space, I think SVM would be a good choice."

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",

    "**Answer: ** AdaBoost is supposed to take different weak models and compound where each of them are doing well. The weak learners that are normally used in practice are decision trees. Decision trees use a tree-like graphs to ask questions regarding the data at hand, and expect to reach conclusions regarding the data at the end of the proccess. Generally speaking, even though individual learners are called \"weak models\", they are expected to perform better than naive predictors. An example of a naive predictor can be a model that always outputs more than 50k for each person. In terms of technical parameters, it is expected that weak learner would also outperform a naive predictor. Moreover, a weak learner is assumed to do a good job on a small subset of data. However, in the light of the whole data set, each of the weak learners are expected to do a poor job. This is where AdaBoost comes to help us out. AdaBoost takes into account where each of the weak learners did good job and gives them greater say in those areas. Assuming, that we had enough weak learners which performed reasonbly well over all of the data set, it is expected that their combination will output a model that in itself performs well over all of the data set.

    "**Answer:** Here the most important features in acsending order are education-num, hours-per-week, capital-gain, age, and capital-loss. I was able to predict three of the features correctly. I didn't include capital gain or loss in my initial answer and rather chose to enter native-country and occupation to the top five.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Capital asset is everyting that you own or use for personal or investment purposes, which includes stocks, bonds, house, furnishing that one owns. When the asset is sold, the difference between the amount you paid for the asset and the amount that you sold it for is called accordingly capital gain or capital loss (https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/ten-important-facts-about-capital-gains-and-losses). With this definition in mind, in essence capital gain or loss shows the net gain or loss from the transaction. Given a pretty large number for capital gain, it is obvious that a person should be wealthy. In US, assuming that there is a correlation between wealth of a person and his income, it makes sense that large enough capital gain would be correlated with making more than 50K. The exact opposite reasoning can be used for capital loss to make predictions about income of a person.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Capital gain/loss makes it to the top three of our list as they explain in numerical terms a person's wealth. In contrast, none of the other features, including occupation and native-country, give us any exact numbers regarding person's financial condition (I already provided my reasoning as to why age makes it to the second place in the answer for question six). \n",
    "   \n",
    "   After this reasoning we are left to choose two candidates from hours-per-week, education-num, native-country, and occupation. In US, most of people get their income based on the number of hours they work. Hence, it is obvious that hours-per-week makes it to the top five. From the remaining three, education-num makes it to the top five as most of the high paying jobs in US actually require in the very least bachelor's degree. Education-num already gives us information about a person's education level and hence the income level a person is most likely to end up with, based on his qualifications.\n",

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
